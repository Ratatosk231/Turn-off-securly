This is a method called LTMEAT (Literally the meatiest exploit of all time).
What you do, is go to your extension bar, right click on securly and go to manage extension.
At the end of the manage extension url, there is a long 34 digit code (all letters) that you need to copy.
This is the extension id and you paste it in this, where it goes chrome-extension://EXTENSION-ID-HERE/manifest.json
Bookmark this page as A, and make it easily accessable.
Now bookmark chrome://kill and chrome://hang
Chrome kill is bookmarked as "B" and chrome hang is bookmarked as "C". These should be right next to each other and very accssable on your bookmark bar.
Press bookmark A. If it says blocked by client or something, then you didn't put the url in right.
Press B, then withen 2 seconds of pressing B, spam click C and spam the reload button on your computer keyboard.
Spam like this for a few seconds, then securly should be off. If nothing is loading, restart your computer, and try again. This happens if you didn't start spamming C soon enough.
